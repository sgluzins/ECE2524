Currency Converter

An idea for an assignment is to create a currency converter. I was thinking this assignment should be a python script, since that was the language that we worked with a lot for similar tasks. What I had in mind was a student may choose between 4 different currencies to work with (this allows for a bit of a creative aspect). From there, the student will create a simple currency converter that would work on the command line (I feel as though if the assignment were worth more than 30 points, retrieving and writing to data files would be a good implementation). 

The student would go ahead and choose 4 curriencies other than the U.S. Dollar. There will be a command that shows the "exchange rate" for all of the currencies (this would be the exchange rate of the students choosing when he/she researches, since the exchange rate does change daily). Also, there will be commands to convert to and from each of the 5 currencies. A readme will be provided by the student that will specify how he/she referred to the currency in order to properly run their program.

Since the student gets to choose 4 other countries of ones choosing, I think it will be a bit interesting because the student will need to do a little research about the currencies that he/she chooses.
